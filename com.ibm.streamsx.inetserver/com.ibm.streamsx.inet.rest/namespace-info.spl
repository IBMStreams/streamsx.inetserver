/**
 * A set of operators using HTTP (REST) apis to interact with
 * streaming data.
 *
 * These operators all embed an instance of Eclipse Jetty
 * to provide an web-server embedded within the operator.
 * 
 * Access to streaming data is provided through
 * the [HTTPTupleView] and [HTTPXMLView] operators.
 * These two operators support `HTTP GET` requests
 * to fetch the latest version of the streaming data in
 * the operator's state.
 *
 * Data can be injected into a stream through 
 * [HTTPTupleInjection], [HTTPXMLInjection], [HTTPBLOBInjection] and
 * [HTTPJSONInjection] operators.
 * Each operators extracts data from an `HTTP POST` and
 * submits a tuple on an output port.
 *
 * [WebContext] provides a mechanism to serve files
 * at a fixed web context, a fixed path relative to the
 * root URL of the web server. Note that all the operators
 * also support a fixed context using the `context` and
 * `contextResourceBase` operator parameters. 
 *
 * The [HTTPRequestProcess] operator enables a developer to process HTTP form's 
 * and REST calls in a Streams application and deliver the appropriate response to 
 * the HTTP client.
 * 
 * Overall, these set of operators allow a complete web-application
 * to be self-contained within an SPL application. In addition to
 * the operators the webserver will serve up HTML and Javascript
 * files. Javascript can be used with the JSON data provided
 * by [HTTPTupleView] to visual live data using graphical
 * packages such as [http://dojotoolkit.org|DOJO] and 
 * [http://d3js.org|D3].
 * 
 * Meta-data for the streams connected to the operators is also available through `HTTP GET` requests,
 * to allow JavaScript applications to self-discover the format of the data and the to self-discover the connected 
 * streams and exposed contexts:
 * * `ports/info` Meta information of the connected ports
 * * `contexts/info` Meta information of the exposed contexts
 * * `/` default context mapped to `application_directory/opt/html`
 * 
 * More fixed contexts are provided by the operators:
 * * `streamsx.inet.resources` Utilities provided by the operators.
 * * `streamsx.inet.dojo` The Dojo Javascript library located at `$STREAMS_INSTALL/ext/dojo`. 
 * 
 * [HTTPTupleView] provides automatic visualization of tuples on its input ports.
 * These are available through the URL `streamsx.inet.resources/dojo/viewall.html`.
 * 
 * This provides a table containing links for all the ports connected to all HTTPTupleView
 * operators using the same Jetty webserver: The columns in the table are:
 * * *Info* - Link to the JSON meta data about the port, including the names and types of the attributes.
 * * *Live Table* - Link to a live table of the current viewable data. Some automatic formatting is applied based upon the name and type of an attribute.
 * * *Live Table (Raw)* - Link to a live table of the current viewable data, with no formatting.
 * * *JSON Data* - Link that provides the raw JSON data.
 * This tables use the Dojo Javascript library from the Steams install, and thus do
 * not require external internet connectivity.
