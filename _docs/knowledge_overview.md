The INet Server Toolkit
The Internet Toolkit provides support for common internet rest protocol and web socket server protocol.
This toolkit is a split from streamsx.inet 2.9.6
[streams.inet v2.9.6](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.inet/tree/v2.9.6)

This toolkit implements the NLS feature. Use the guidelines for the message bundle that are described in [The messages and the NLS for toolkits](https://github.com/IBMStreams/administration/wiki/Messages-and-National-Language-Support-for-toolkits)
